# **_Nero's Pizza_**

Nero's Pizza is a small recently opened (fictional) pizzeria based in Oranmore, Galway, Ireland. The site is for a new business and is targeted at people around the area (and beyond) to get to know the business more.

The site was designed using the mobile first development model with additional media queries for devices with larger screens.

<i>Why Mobile First?</i> Over half of website traffic comes from mobile devices and over 90% of internet users access the internet using a mobile phone. <a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/mobile-internet-traffic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a>

## Wireframes

The wireframes for Nero's Pizza were produced in [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com). As I started developing the website and looking for inspiration. The final website does differ but the idea remains the same.

## Site Structure

Nero's Pizza website has three pages. The [home page](index.html) is the default loading page, the [menu](menu.html), and the [contact us](contact-us.html). All pages are accessible from the navigation menu and for mobile using the hamburger style menu.

## Design Choices

* ### Fonts

The fonts chosen were 'Fredericka The Great' for the Pizzeria's Name and slogan and  'Poppins' for the body text. They fall back to sans-serif if neither font is available on the viewing device. 

  *  'Fredericka The Great' was chosen for the headings. After seeing it on a past Code Institute project and liking it. 

   * 'Poppins' is used for the body text as it is a clear font and easy to read (I tried several other fonts but found it easiest to read).

 * ### Color Scheme


I played around with different colors on the website but because I am a complete novice I decided to let AI help me to decide. So, I to upload the first image users will see when the visit site to Canva's - online color palette generator. (https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/). I liked two of the four (milano red and creole) color suggestions and thought they would suit my website. Both colors would also suit the remaining photos as they are of similar contrast and styling.

# Technologies Used
* [HTML5](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/) - provides the content and structure for the website.
* [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html) - provides the styling.
* [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) - used to create the wireframes.
* [Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - was used to code locally after being recommended by a fellow student on the course. I started initially using Codeanywhere but due to its slowness and some issues when I was following and coding along with the Code Institute's excellent Love Running walkthrough project. I decided to look for an alternative.
* [Github](https://github.com/) - was used to store the project's webpages and images. After every session I pushed the updates to github for further validation and testing.
