# **_Nero's Pizza_**

Nero's Pizza is a small recently opened (fictional) pizzeria based in Oranmore, Galway, Ireland. The site is in its infancy as is targeted at people around the area (and beyond) to view the pizzeria menu and discover what's on offer.

The site was designed using the mobile first development model with additional media queries for devices with larger screens.

<i>Why Mobile First?</i> Over half of website traffic comes from mobile devices and over 90% of internet users access the internet using a mobile phone. <a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/mobile-internet-traffic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a>

## Wireframes

The wireframes for Nero's Pizza were produced in [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com). As I started developing the website and looking for inspiration. The final website does differ but the idea remains the same.

## Site Structure

Nero's Pizza website has three pages. The [home page](index.html) is the default loading page, the [menu](menu.html), and the [contact us](contact-us.html). All pages are accessible from the navigation menu and for mobile using the hamburger style menu.

## Design Choices

 * ### Typography

      The fonts chosen were 'Fredericka The Great' for the Pizzeria's Name and slogan and  'Poppins' for the body text. They fall back to sans-serif if neither font is available on the viewing device. 
     *  'Fredericka The Great' was chosen for the headings. After seeing it on a past Code Institute's project and liking it. 
      * 'Poppins' is used for the body text as it is a clear font and easy to read (I tried several other fonts but found it easiest to read).

 * ### Color Scheme

Being a complete novice to website design. I decided to upload the first image users will see when the visit site to Canva's- online color palette generator. (https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/). I liked two of the four (milano red and creole) color suggestions and thought they would suit my website. Both colors would also suit the remaining photos as they are of similar contrast and styling.

# Features

The website site contains many features that the user would probably be familiar with, such as a hamburger menu (mobile) and navigation bar (for larger screens) and contact form. Along with the location of the business.

## Existing Features  

  * ### Hamburger/Navigation Menu

    * The hamburger menu (for mobiles) and navigation links for larger screens are located at the top of all the pages in the site (within the header section), it is fully responsive and contains links to all the pages of the site to enable ease of navigation in one convenient location.

    * The restaurant name is clickable with a link back to the home page. It is a constant across all webpages.

  * ### About-Us
    * The About Us section lets the user know what Nero's Pizza is and who we are. 
    * An inbedded link to the contact section in the text will help the user navigate quickly to the next step of the project process.

* ### Footer
    
    * Contains social media links. To enhance the UX the links open in other tabs.
    * The social media presence will help the user with their research into Nero's Pizza and will also encourage them to connect with Nero's Pizza.
    * To help the user with navigation on all devices a 'scroll to the top' arrow was added. It sticks to the bottom left of the screen at all times to give the user a quick and unobstructed way to the navigation bar. The arrow is semi-transparent with a light/dark contrasting border for use against all background colors.
    * The GitHub and LinkedIn social links are there for the educational side of this project. They would be removed if this site was deployed outside of this project.

# Technologies Used
* [HTML5](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/) - provides the content and structure for the website.
* [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html) - provides the styling.
* [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) - used to create the wireframes.
* [Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - was used to code locally after being recommended by a fellow student on the course. I started initially using Codeanywhere but due to its slowness and some issues when I was following the Code Institutes Love Running walkthrough project. I decided to look for an alternative.
* [Github](https://github.com/) - was used to store the project's webpages and images. After every session I pushed the updates to github for further validation and testing.
